                    <p>In order for the internet to become “weird” again, its interface must become simpler. By that I mean the control these large companies, such as Google, hold over the internet should be relinquished. As well as the use of AI ruining research and discouraging unique and complex processes of thought. In doing so, it would allow the internet to become a free open space for its users, much like how it operated in the late nineties to early two thousands. Much of the internet nowadays has been capitalized upon. Most websites are now hidden behind paywalls whereas in the early nineties, Email was free to everyone worldwide (Greene 162). This use of email not only leveled the playing field as everyone had equal access to the platform, but it also created international relationships and spread ideas freely and independently further than was physically possible.</p>

                    <p>“Reweirding” the internet would require not only the dispersion of large net companies but also for styling and code to become more interesting. Many of the designs we see today, while they are meant to be eye-catching, in order for us to buy the items being advertised, they are not thought-provoking. While they may draw an audience in, is it really enough to keep them there? Bringing back interactive websites like Olia Lialina’s My Boyfriend Came Back From the War, where the purpose of these sites is to share art and encourage complex thought, most websites now just want our attention so they can get our money and time as well. While you may not physically “get” anything from these net art websites, they might do more for you mentally and create a better sense of empathy and understanding across the web. Whereas today, we experience a lot of hate on our version of the web. Ultimately, in making the internet “simpler,” it would create more room for experimentation and therefore would make it “weirder”.
